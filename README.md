# Rainfall Prediction Classifier Model

This project focuses on building and evaluating a machine learning model for a classification task. The primary objective is to accurately predict outcomes based on a given set of features. The repository contains the complete workflow, from initial data exploration and feature selection to model training, evaluation, and interpretation. A secondary goal was to use unsupervised learning to discover any inherent structures within the data.
